**hump** - Helper Utilities for a Multitude of Problems
=======================================================

**hump** is a set of lightweight helpers for the awesome `LÃ–VE
<http://love2d.org>`_ game framework.
It will help to get you over the initial hump when starting to build a new
game.

**hump** does nothing that you couldn't do yourself.
But why should you?
You want to write games, not boilerplate!

**hump**'s components are so loosely coupled that every component is
independent of the others.
You can choose what you need and leave the rest behind.
hump wont judge.

**hump** just wants to make you happy.
