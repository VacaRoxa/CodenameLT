Installation on Linux
=====================

We provide both a .snap build and a .love build.

Snap build can be installed directly from the global store using:

    sudo snap install codenamelt

Alternatively, .snap downloaded  from the release can be installed using:

    sudo snap install --devmode codenamelt_*_amd64.snap

The flag --devmode just allows installing the game without being provided by an
online store. You can run a installed snap by using:

    codenamelt.lovegame

The .love file can be ran by installing love2d as provided by www.love2d.org or
by installing the love package from your distribution.

You can look into all love versions in : https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/
